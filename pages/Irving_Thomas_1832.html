    <p id="Thomas_Irving_1832">
      <p class="date">Abt. 1832</p>
      <p>Born: Dumfriesshire, Scotland.</p>
      
      <h3><b>Notes.</b></h3>
      <p>No conclusive evidence that Thomas was the father of our known great-great grandfather Thomas (abt. 1855-1884).</p>
      <p>I have found on Thomas's (1832- ) sister Catherine's death certificate, the informant was John Ann McBryde, Grandpop's sister. And she said that she was her grand-niece.
      Also interesting is that Grandpop's father must have had a close relationship with his aunt Catherine as he appears to name grandpop after Catherine's husband, George Birrell.</p>
      <p>I have DNA hits for decendants of Thomas(1832), which prooves that I am related but he had mooved to England and had a different family.
      Maybe Thomas had an early marriage or relationship.</p>
      <p>I have found no evidence for Mary (Margaret) Gordon that was shown on Thomas's (1855) death certificate. There are Gordon's burried in the Dornock Cemetery.
      The 1861 census shows that Thomas (1855-1884) was living with his grandparents, Joseph & Jane Irving also there was his aunt Mary. (Could have been his mother). </p>
      <p>The informant on Thomas's (1855-1884) death certificate was Thomas's father-in-law, John Scott. He stated that Thomas's father and mother were Thomas Irving Miller (grain) and Margaret Irving nee Gordon.</p>
