    <h1 >About Me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my web page. This page was set up purely to learn a new skill in developing  web pages and sharing many of my interests.</p>				

				<p>I am retired, married with two children and living in the Nations Capital, Canberra, Australia.</p>				

				<p>My entire working career of forty years was spent in the Telecommunications industry. Starting with the P.M.G, Telecom, Telstra and finally N.D.C, an installation company owned by Telstra.</P>				

				<p>I was lucky to work in an ever changing industry, working in most aspects of communication. From magneto telephone and manual switchboards, the introduction of the digital era, radio, mobile phones, 1st Space Shuttle, fibre optics, computers to satellite communication.</p> 

				<p>My hobbies in retirement are: Woodworking, genealogy, model trains and trying to keep up with changes in computer technology and programming in general.</p>
