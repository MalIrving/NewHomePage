        Henry and Ann and their family move from the Hunter River to Ulmarra
        aboard the ship "Grafton". They are the first members of the family to
        do so. - We know that Ann's sister Barbara visited Ann and Henry soon
        after they went to live at Ulmarra, so, it is not difficult to imagine
        her returning home to her parents, John and Ann, with encouraging
        reports of the new, developing area, persuading the family to move their
        place of residence to the Clarence River. This move occurred on
        February, 1859 following severe flooding on the William's River area of
        the Hunter River valley.

        Tobacco and Cotton.<br />
        We are glad to observe that some of our experimental farmers have
        commenced the cultivation of the tobacco plant. Mr. Johnson, who is in
        connection with Mr. H. Leeson, of this place, has, during the last two
        years, raised several crops, equaling both in quantity and quality, any
        we have hitherto seen. This year, Mr. J. Miller, of Burn's farm, has
        already planted about an acre of land with tobacco seed, as an
        experiment; and the same gentleman intends, provided he obtains the
        seed, preparing a portion of land, for the cultivation of the cotton
        plant. Perhaps, some more of our Ulmarra farmers will be persuaded to
        follow their example, and give the plants a fair trial.<br />

        Private Sugar Mill.<br />
        We have much pleasure is stating that our respected and enterprising
        neighbor, Mr. Henry Leeson, has determined to create a sugar mill. We
        hope that every cane grower on the Clarence, heartily wishes Mr. Leeson
        success, for the salvation of the planters in this district, to get rid
        of a giant monopoly, evidently depends solely on private enterprise.<br />

        Southgate.<br />
        Mr. Leeson's Sugar Mill.<br />
        We have very great pleasure in recording the complete success of Mr.
        Leeson's mill, which has recently been erected under the skillful
        superintendence of Mr. Robert Muir.<br />
        The following description of it will doubtless prove interesting to the
        cane growers of the Clarence. The mill is horizontal 18 inches x 18
        inches and is driven by six horses. The main lying shaft works overhead,
        thereby raising the mill and allowing the liquor to gravitate first into
        clarifiers, then into ----, and lastly into the battery. The machinery
        was manufactured by Messrs. Chapman and Co., Sydney, according to Mr.
        Muir's orders and design, is of excellent workmanship, and strong in all
        its parts.<br />
        Battery.<br />
        The main battery is 18 feet long, made of sheet iron, with cast iron
        ta_|he of 60 gallons at one end, and all boiled by one fire. This
        battery, the design of Mr. Muir, is of the cheapest and simplest
        construction, and can easily evaporate juice for 15 cwt. sugar, a
        day.<br />
        Centrifugal.<br />
        The centrifugal is driven off the main shaft on to a counter shaft, to
        get up speed to 1200 revolutions per minute. It works splendidly, and
        dries a charge of sugar in three minutes. Six horses work both mill and
        centrifugal at the same time. Owing to the scarcity of cane at the
        present season, the mill is not working full time, only boiling about
        five hours a day and turning out in that time 6 cwt. of sugar, worth 37
        pounds per ton. In the proper season, with good cane, and working full
        time, the mill will easily turn out half-a-ton of sugar daily, but Mr.
        Muir guarantee that under his own management, the mill will turn out 15
        cwt. under similar circumstances. Mr. Muir invites those who are
        skeptical on this point to visit the mill, and he will clearly
        demonstrate the truth of the statement. The cost of machinery and
        erection is considerably under 500 pounds. It may be interesting to
        state, that several large cane growers, who have visited Mr. Leeson's
        factory, are so convinced of its success that they have commissioned Mr.
        Muir to procure and erect for them mills of a similar construction, and
        consequently that gentleman will be able to make a considerable
        reduction of his charges for uperintending the erection of them. The
        satisfactory results achieved by Mr. Leeson's mill, in the face of many
        difficulties, in respect of the quantity and quality of the cane
        operated upon, are, we think, a crushing refutation of the statement so
        frequently and recklessly made by interested parties, that small mills
        cannot be worked to a profit. Mr. Muir, by his uccess at Carr's Creek
        and Southgate, has demonstrated beyond the possibility of a doubt, that
        small mills can be advantageously worked, and that the successful
        manipulation of sugar does not depend upon large establishments and
        costly machinery. We venture to predict that the day is not far distant,
        when every sugar planter residing on the banks of the noble Clarence
        will have a mill of his own, and thus be independent of any Sugar
        Company.We understand that in another _ week Mr. Muir expects to have in
        operation Mr. David Kirk's mill, which is of the same construction and
        power as Mr. Leeson's. Messrs. Leeson and Kirk are deserving of the
        highest praise for the energy and perseverance displayed by them in the
        prosecution and undertaking, and we feel assured that ere long, both
        will reap a rich reward.<br />

        Sugar From Frost-Bitten Cane.<br />
        We have received some splendid bright counter sugar, made from ten
        months' growth frost-bitten ribbon cane, manufactured at Mr. Leeson's
        Southgate mill. It is really a first-class sample, and worth at least 34
        pounds per ton; and it must be very gratifying to our settlers to know
        that their sugar cane, when frost-bitten, is not wholly destroyed, as
        the cane, if it has lost any of its saccharine matter, must still retain
        a large proportion, in order to be able to produce from such cane a
        sugar equal to that before us.<br />

        The Weather and Crops.<br />
        No doubt you think it very negligent on my part by not giving you an
        account of our doings in this obscure corner of the district. Though we
        have not complained, I think we have had just cause to do so. The late
        floods, did a deal of injury to the potato, barley, and other crops, and
        also rendering the low lands unfit for tilling for some considerable
        time. Since then the weather has taken a decided change, having hot
        clear days and cold frosty nights, but am happy to inform you as yet,
        has not done any material damage to the sugar cane, which, as you aware,
        is now the staple product of our parish. Our energetic neighbor - Mr. H.
        Leeson - through his indefatigable efforts, has at last proved beyond a
        doubt that Sugar Mills on a small scale, will give excellent returns, as
        the following facts will show. The trial crushing was from China cane
        ten months old ratoons, a little more than half an acre, gave excellent
        return of one ton three hundred weight of first-class sugar - worth 38
        pounds per ton. Since then he has been crushing ribbon cane from which
        he is turning out fourteen hundred weight of first-class sugar daily.
        These facts speak volumes for the small mill at Southgate, and its
        speculative owner, and I trust ere long we have the pleasure of
        congratulating many more mill owners with the same success. The wealthy
        manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's Mill here - Mr. E. W.
        Knox has arrived, and I believe they purpose starting about the end of
        the month - the sooner the better, as a deal of the two years old cane
        is blown up by the roots, owing to its immense weight.<br />

        The Clarence Sugar Industry. A Tour Among the Mills.<br />
        On the opposite of Southgate Creek, between it and the river, the
        distance about half a mile, is the mill of Messers. Leeson and Boothby.
        Mr H. Leeson started in 1872, with a mill worked by horses. This was
        sold after the season of 1880, and it was replaced in 1881, with the
        plant now in use, which is a ten h.p. engine, with vacuum pan and is
        therefore the second season for its use. The pan is capable of taking a
        ton charge. The mill employs about twelve hands, most of whom are
        members of the family, or from adjoining farms, and it is capable of
        putting 25 tons of cane through daily. First, second, third and fourth
        boilings are got, and, as good evidence of the carefulness of the
        treatment, Mr Boothby informs me that local buyers consider his molasses
        not so valuable as other qualities they get. The reason is, that in
        their case all the sugar possible is extracted and that is the point
        that every manufacturer should aim at. I saw the first and second
        sugars, which were bagged, and tested the coolers containing third and
        fourth boilings, which also give a good percentage of sugar. The samples
        being bagged were each good of their respective qualities.<br />

        The Messrs. Leeson have been growing cane since 1868, having for some
        years sold to the Colonial Sugar Company, before starting their own
        mill. Like many others, who have since become manufacturers, they did
        not object to the price paid by the company, which was admitted to be a
        fair one; but the desire to have their canes cut early; and all
        quantities, induced them to erect a small mill of their own. This seems
        to be the difficulty, which even now prevents planters from renewing
        their agreements with the Colonial Sugar Company. The farmers allege
        that the Company will only take first-class cane, and leave the other on
        their lands; and this they find a difficulty in disposing of. It must
        eventually resolve itself into this: that the grower will be paid for
        the quality of the cane, just as the manufacturer is paid various prices
        for his sugar.<br />

        The Messrs. Leeson started growing the Light and Dark Purple, China,
        Meere, Ribbon, Fiji and Fiji Ribbon. The Dark Purple took the rust, and
        was condemned. The China became badly frosted, and was given up. The
        Fiji canes, which were introduced by Mr. Melmoth Hall, were also given
        up after a time. They are now growing the Ribbon, Rappoe, Salangore and
        Meera, and have 30 acres under cultivation. Mr Boothby says the Rappoe
        stands best in some places but he prefers the Salangore, which gives
        them the best returns. They have given it a good trial, having had it
        for seven or eight seasons.<br />

        It grows very well as ratoons with them, but it is described as having
        rather weak eyes, which makes it an uncertain grower from cuttings.<br />

        First rattoons give a density averaging 8 degrees, which is the same
        credited to the Rappoe by them. These two canes they consider the best
        now grown here. They have had cane in the ground eight or nine years,
        but Mr Boothby acknowledges it is a mistake, and a loss to cultivate in
        this way. With annual canes, he considers six years quite long enough
        without replanting. He thinks a good deal of cane is injured by a bad
        system of cutting, which should properly be done at the surface of the
        ground, with a clean level cut. He thinks the Rappoe can be cut as early
        as you like, without endangering the cane, but if it does not go down as
        much as the Rappoe. These varieties of cane are not trashed, as it is
        found that it falls off as the cane ripens, and to trash before the
        frosts are over is ruinous to the cane. In respect to the present
        season, Mr Boothby does not think it worse than the last, and ascribes
        the damage done to the cane as attributable more to the effects of the
        dry weather than the frosts. Their crushing season will last to the end
        of October, and they will have less cane to put through than last year.
        No growers about their mill are giving up cane-growing, and where cane
        is being ploughed out is with the view of substituting more suitable
        varieties. This mill turns out a large quantity of sugar, and the owners
        evidently thoroughly understand the work of boiling, and have instructed
        many of the neighbouring small mill-owners.<br />

        these was Mr. Henry Leeson, who came to the Clarence with his family 32
        years ago. being one of the early settlers that arrived from the
        Williams River. He first settled in Ulmarra, when, after residing for
        some years, he went to Southgate, and with his son, and son-in-law, Mr.
        Boothby, he erected in 1870 one of the first private sugar mills opened
        in the district, which is still in operation. Twelve years ago he left
        for the Richmond, and erected a sugar mill at Long Reach, between Swan
        Bay and Coraki. He had been a long sufferer, and finding his earthly
        career drawing to a close, Mr Leeson came to Southgate, where he
        expired. His mortal remains were interred in the Church of England on
        Saturday, and were followed to their final resting place by a numerous
        company of mourners, The other death was that of Mrs. Jenkins, a well
        known resident, who was buried on Sunday.<br />
