      <p> THE TEMPLAR<br/>
        All the single females and a considerable number of the male immigrants (inclusive of those with families) by this ship have been engaged in a much shorter time than those by other vessels which have immediately preceded her. There are several agriculturists of experience from the midland and western counties of England yet remaining; and as the Templar is the last immigrant ship for Sydney this season, or probably until the beginning of next year, we have no doubt the remainder will go off quickly.<br/>
        
        EMIGRATION TO NEW SOUTH WALES<br/>
        The splendid ship Templar, Capt Brown, one of the vessels chartered by Messrs Carter and Bonus with emigrants for this colony, is now lying at Cove and will sail for her destination on the 16th inst. From having visited, and minutely examined the accommodations which this superior vessel affords for a long voyage, we are enabled to express an unqualified opinion as to the admirable arrangements by which the care, comfort and convenience of her passengers are ensured. The cabins are elegantly fitted up, spacious and airy, and the berths between decks are most commodious and well ventilated, while the classification and good order in every department cannot be too highly praised.<br/>
        
        The Hospital department is as perfectly fitted up as any medical institution of the same extent could be on shore, and the passengers are under the medical superintendance of Dr Williams, who is represented to us as a particularly humane, attentive and experienced practitioner. There are on board 300 steerage, and fourteen cabin passengers. Among the latter are Commissary-General Ramsay and family. The steerage passengers, half of whom are from this country, were specially selected by John Besnard Esq, Emigration Agent at this port, and are principally of that class most likely to succeed in the land of their adoption.<br/>
        
        They are farmers with their families, farm labourers and servants, and operative mechanics, chiefly connected with the building trade. We have been satisfactorily informed that a large amount of specie is taken out of the country by the emigrants of a superior class proceeding by this vessel. One party alone has on board in cash and valuable securities over £35,000 and the whole amount of specie taken out in the Templar exceeds £60,000. It will be in the recollection of our readers that it was in this one vessel the Archbishop of Australia, the Rt. Right Rev. Dr Polding, accompanied by eighteen clergymen, sailed from Ireland last year for the scene of their distant mission, and after an agreeable and prosperous voyage, presented Captain Browne with a valuable Silver Box, in testimony of their appreciation of his nautical abilities and courteous demeanor. Several Naval and Military officers and a considerable number of Ladies and Gentlemen from Cork visited the Templar since her arrival in Cove, and have expressed themselves much gratified with her superior accommodation and excellent arrangements-Southern Reporter.<br/>

      <p>Marmaduke dies, South Grafton, New South Wales.</p>
      <p> SUDDEN DEATH.
        A magisterial inquiry was held yesterday, before Mr. T. Fisher, J. P., at the residence of George Morris, near South Grafton, touching the death of Marmaduke Leeson, who came to Morris's place on Saturday, remained there all night, and was found dead in his bed on Sunday morning. - Constable Carnes, who examined the body found a bottle of medicine at the foot of the deceased with the label of Mr. Krause, chemist;
        there were no marks of violence on the body. - Simon Belinfante, M. D., stated that he had examined the body of deceased, and found a great swelling of the abdomen from mere tapping, the lungs appeared healthy, and there was nothing in the appearance of the body to indicate the cause of death, the medicine produced seemed to contain a great quantity of the oil of copaiba; judging by the taste, the oil seemed to be quite on
        the top, and if a large quantity of such was taken more particularly by a man the age of deceased, it would be sufficient to accelerate, if not cause death altogether; if the medicine was shaken before taken it would not be dangerous; his death might have been the result of old age; he did not observe any symptoms to lead to any other conclusion, unless it were the swelling of the abdomen, which might have been the
        result of natural causes, although such is not the general rule. The deceased who was the father of Mr. Christopher Leeson, of Ulmarra, was seventy years of age, which may account for his sudden demise.

    <article><em>Note.</em><br/>
      On board the "Templar" was also Robert Johnson, brother of Mary Johnson. This was discovered from Robert's obituary by accident.
      Robert paid his own fare of 20 pounds.
      He was also employed on his arrival by Wiliam Bowden, mooving to the Hunter and finally to Southate with the Leeson's. He purchased a farm next to Henry and Christopher Leeson at Southgate.
      Robert did not marry, and in 1863 he sponsored his nephew and wife to help on the farm.
      It is interesting that Robert's nephew William Johnson and his future wife were employed on the same farm in Ulceby as Thomas Boothby and his father William Boothby. (1851 English cencus).
      So Thomas Boothby was known to the family before arriving in Australia.
      William Johnson's wife Kezia has the same name as Henry Leeson's youngest daughter.
      In Robert Johnson's obituary it is noted that he referred Marmaduke Leeson as Duke Leeson.
