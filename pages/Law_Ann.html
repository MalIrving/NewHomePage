        The Voyage and Arrival in Australia.<br />

        On 2nd June, 1841, Ann and John Law, together with their three children,
        Ann, James, and Barbara, left Dundee in the barque, "Mathesis." for
        Sydney, Australia. Whilst crossing the Atlantic Ocean the ship's hold
        caught fire and the pumps had to be used continually until the ship
        reached Rio de Janeiro. As a result of the fire the family had to spend
        three months in Rio while the ship was repaired. Barbara, the youngest,
        had to be watched very carefully as she was a beautiful child and the
        Moors (from Nth. Africa) wanted her, and, because her paremts would not
        sell her they had to be careful that the Moors did not take her. The
        voyage from Rio resumed on 24th November, 1841. The family arrived in
        Sydney 30th January, 1842. From Sydney they continued their journey to
        the Wiliams River district where they settled to farm work near Dungog.
        In 1859 the family moved to the Clarence River and lived at Ulmarra for
        a few years before taking up land at Kings Creek, near Lawrence in
        1862.<br />

        Henry and Ann and their family move from the Hunter River to Ulmarra
        aboard the ship "Grafton". They are the first members of the family to
        do so. - We know that Ann's sister Barbara visited Ann and Henry soon
        after they went to live at Ulmarra, so, it is not difficult to imagine
        her returning home to her parents, John and Ann, with encouraging
        reports of the new, developing area, persuading the family to move their
        place of residence to the Clarence River. This move occurred on
        February, 1859 following severe flooding on the William's River area of
        the Hunter River valley.
