        No record of birth certificate, so could be in another parish or pre
        1855. Marriage certificate: 25th June 1875 at Annan Parish Church, aged
        20 years. Death certificate: 21st July 1884 at Blackhills, Annan aged 28
        years, of Rheumatic fever, Pericarditis and Endocarditis.

        He had different jobs and different addresses on his children's birth
        certificates. This was quite common at that time as servents and workman
        were selected at the yearly "hirings". He had been a farm servent, a
        ploughman and at his death a freestone quarryman (see back of town map
        re. quarry).

        As Mary Scott had named her first illegitimate child Thomas Irving
        Scott, it looks as though he fathered it at 16 or 17 yrs, old. Also the
        baby was born at Newbie Barns, where Thomas's mother had lived.
