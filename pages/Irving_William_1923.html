      <p>William was born on the 27th December, 1923, at the Royal Womens Hospital, Paddington, New South Wales. </p>
      <p>He was the second son of George Birrell Irving and Jean Grey Reid of 113 Caledonian Street, Bexley, New South Wales.</p>

      <p>On his marriage in 1947, Bill and his young family lived at his parents, whilst clearing and beginning to build the family home on a bush block in Oyster Bay.</p>
