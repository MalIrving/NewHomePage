        <p>Obituary.<br />
        MR. WILLIAM LEESON.<br />
        The death occurred at his residence, "Inglewood," Charlton, Toowoomba,
        of William Leeson, one of the Southgate pioneers. Born on the Williams
        River 82 years ago, at the age of eight he came to the district.
        Educational facilities were not what they are to-day, there being no
        schools in the district, and the subject of our notice at the age of
        nine was in charge of his father's bullock teams. Notwithstanding lack
        of education, the late Mr. Leeson later became a keen business man. He
        was one of the original selectors under the John Robertson Act, and his,
        early butchering business was well-known. He was the first man to
        introduce commercial butter-making to Southgate, purchasing from Mr.
        Goodyer, of Pillar Valley, a separator, which was turned by horseworks.
        This was carried on for twelve months, and with the inception of a
        factory at Ulmarra, supplies were sent there for some time, later
        reverting to Southgate, with the introduction of more modern machinery.
        A good horseman and bushman, his name is assaociated with Arthur
        Anderson in the discovery of William Kory, whose rescue after being lost
        in the bush, is one of the features of early Southgate history. About
        twenty-six years ago he sold his property, "Highlands," on which he
        settled on his marriage in 1891, and acquired a property at Charlton,
        Darling Downs, Queensland. He is survived by a Widow (who was Miss
        Caroline Paine, a sister of Mr. F. W. Paine, of Maclean), three sons,
        Fred, Charlie and Reg, and one daughter, Dulcie (Mrs. Nauman).<br />

        OBITUARY.<br />
        MR. WILLIAM LEESON.<br />
        The death of Mr. William Leeson, of the Darling Downs, at the age of 83,
        removes one who in his day was amongst the outstanding figures of the
        early pioneers of the Clarence River. <br />
        Born on the Hunter, he went to the Clarence with his parents 80 years
        ago, his father having secured a farm from the late Thomas Small on a
        clearing lease. The farm so cleared is the site of the present township
        of Ulmarra. <br />
        A few years after the farm was cleared the family moved across the river
        to Southgate, and there Mr. Leeson resided for half a century, removing
        to the Downs some 27 years ago. <br />
        During his long residence at Southgate, Mr. Leeson won a high reputation
        for his probity, neighbourly at tributes, and undoubted abilities as a
        progressive farmer and dairyman. While at Southgate, he married a
        daughter of the late Richard Paine, who, with three sons and one
        daughter survive. One son, Frederick, resides at Newrybar. <br />
        Mr. Jns Leeson, of Bungawalbin, is the sole remaining brother, and Mrs.
        Rayner, of The Glebe, Coraki, the only surviving sister.<br />
