      <p class="date">Notes</p>
      <p>
        There is confusion of who John's parents are. Most put David Dalrymple &
        Jean Bell, but on his death cert it states that his parents were John
        Dalrymple & Catherine Bell. Are these the same people?
      </p>
      <p>
        Cannot find marriage of John & Catherine. No deaths for John Dalrymple
        before 1855, Scotish People.
      </p>
      <p>1872 death John Dalrymple, Annan wrong person as he was single.</p>
