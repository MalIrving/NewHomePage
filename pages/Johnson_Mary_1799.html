      <em>
        <em>Marmaduke like so may other immigrants may have learnt to read and write
        on the long voyage out as he signed his name to the immigration papers
        but used his mark on his marriage certificate. His signiture on the
        immigration papers was M Duke Leeson, so he may have gone by the
        nickname Duke. This may have led to the confusion in many researchers
        that he was a Duke attached to the Irish brewery family.</em>
