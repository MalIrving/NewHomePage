            21 Officers and 589 other ranks, selected from all units of the
            A.I.F., were marched into barracks Abbassia. Thus began one month of
            intensive training in all aspects of military police duties and
            soldiering. Those men who failed to meet the rigid requirement of
            the new Corps, were marched out, and returned to their units. From
            inception it had been decided that only A class men would be
            accepted into the new Corps. Also to eliminate the perception
            amongst other units in the A.I.F., that men joining the new Corps
            were doing so to evade Active Service. Those men who had not seen
            service in the face of the enemy were transferred to the Desert
            Mounted Corps, on completion of their training. Commanded by, Major
            General H.G. Chauvel CB, CMG., they remained with the Desert Corps,
            until they had seen service in the face of the enemy, and were
            capable of taking their place with the ANZAC Provost Corps (APC).
            After the initial intake, all new recruits must have seen service in
            the face of the enemy. By 1917, the requirements for entry into the
            APC were the strictest of any unit in the A.I.F.

          To whom it may concern.<br />
          George Irving the bearer, was in our employment for six years. He
          served his apprenticeship as a miller here & also he had a large
          experience of farm work on the lands we possess.<br />
          During this time he gave every satisfaction in the mill & on the farm,
          he left nothing to be desired in the performance of his duty.<br />
          Being strictly teetotal and trustworthy we placed a good deal of faith
          in him & in the fewest possible words, he did not fail us.<br />
          He is of an obliging nature and anyone who engages him maybe sure of
          every satisfaction.<br />
          He left our employment to better his position & for no other
          reason.<br />
          We can, with confidence recommend him and whoever engages him may be
          assured of a faithful discharge of his duties.<br />
          R Robinson & Sons<br />
          P.S. The above George Irving, was in our employment from August 20th
          1898 until May 1st 1904.<br />

        1912/07/04 - Testimonial<br />
        <em
          >Corporation Tramways 46 Bath Street Glasgow<br />
          George Irving has been employed in the services of the Glasgow
          Corporation Tramways from 7th February, 1904, until this date. He
          began as a Conductor, but after training as a Motorman, transferred in
          June 1904 to the steady driving list, and has acted as a Motorman
          since that date, occasionally taking a Conductor’s duty.<br />
          I have great pleasure in certifying that Irving has given excellent
          service ti the department and has proved to be, in every respect, a
          trustworthy, competent and sober man. He resigns from the service
          entirely of his own accord.<br />
          Irving has qualified regularly during the last seven years for the
          bonus which is paid to Motormen for freedom from accident.<br />
