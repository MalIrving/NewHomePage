        ASSAULT.</p>
        William and Robert Leeson appeared before the Court upon summons, issued at the instance of one Henry F. Tree, who deposed: He was a farmer, residing at Ulmarra; he saw the defendants on the 10th instant; he was standing near Mr. Cohen's stores at Ulmarra, watching some men playing at quoits; William Leeson was standing beside him, his son and several others; he said "Good day, Mr. Leeson;" whereupon he turned round and said, "That was a very wrong thing of a man like you to carry away my bark;" he said "What do you mean, Mr. Leeson, I know nothing about your bark;" he then said if he accused him of robbery before these parties he would knock him down; he did not lift his hand as if to strike him, as he was turning away from him, Leeson struck him on the mouth and nose; he was cut by the blow and his teeth was loosened; he did not strike him more than once, as Mr. Samuel Cohen held him back; he had no conversation with Robert Leeson; when Mr. Cohen pulled William Leeson away from him, Robert Leeson knocked witness down, he was not aware Robert was there until he knocked him down; the people present prevented Robert striking witness again; Robert Leeson struck him without any provocation. Cross - examined by Robert Leeson: He (defendant) knocked him down and struck him on the head with his foot; after he struck him, he challenged him out. - Andrew Dawdon said he was present on Easter Monday, when some dispute occurred between the parties before the Court; Williain Leeson charged Tree with stealing some bark, whereupon Tree exclaimed, "If you say that again, I will knock you down;" William Leeson replied "What, knock me down;" William without any further remark knocked Tree down; he believed the blow was on the breast or shoulder; William Leeson was pulled away and shortly after Robert Leeson came up and struck him, when he believed Tree fell. By the Bench: He heard no conversation between Robert Leeson and Tree before he was knocked down.
        John Grainger stated he was present but did not see Williain Leeson strike Tree; he heard Robert Leeson say, "If any person wants to fight my brother, he must fight me," with that they closed; all three parties had been drinking; witness went between, and pulled Tree away. Cross-examined by Mr. Foott: He believed Tree had been drinking, he was not drunk; he could not say who had struck the first blow.- William Burns stated that he heard Tree say to William Leeson, "That if he said that again, he would knock him down;" Tree was getting close to William Leeson, when he pushed him back; the next thing he saw was Tree jumping about asking some one to hold his coat; Robert Leeson told Tree not to strike his brother as he was an invalid, and added that if he struck his brother, he would strike him (Tree); they then closed on the ground together, but he saw no blows struck. By the Bench: He was in Tree's company for two hours after; he did not see any marks or blood on Tree. Re-examined by Mr. Foott: He heard Dawson swear that Robert Leeson left the quoits and knocked Tree down; that was not true. The Bench however considered the assault proved, and fined Robert Leeson 10s., and William Leeson 1 pound with costs of Court, or in default, the alternative of forty - eight hours and three day's ncarceration. The fines were paid. Mr. Foott for complainant. The Bench refused to allow professional costs.
